You _could_ do this via `src/components/SocialList.astro`, just be sure to include `isWebmention` to the relevant link if doing so.\n2. Create an account @ [Webmention.io](https://webmention.io/) by entering your website's address.\n3. Add the link feed to `siteConfig.webmentions`, found in `src/site.config.ts`.\n4. Create a `.env` file, or rename the included `.example.env`, and add the key `WEBMENTION_API_KEY` and set the api key.\n5. Go to [brid.gy](https://brid.gy/) and sign-in to each social account[s] you wish to link.\n6. Publish and build your website, remember to add the api key, and it should now be ready to receive webmentions!\n7. That's it, maybe give this post a like!\n\n## What are webmentions\n\nPut simply, it's a way to show users who like, comment, repost and more, on various pages on your website via social media.\n\nThis theme displays the number of likes, mentions and replies each blog post receives. There are a couple of more webmentions that I haven't included, like reposts, which are currently filtered out, but shouldn't be too difficult to include.\n\n## Steps to add it to your own site\n\nYour going to have to create a couple of accounts to get things up-and-running. But, the first thing you need to ensure is that your social links are correct.\n\n### Add link(s) to your profile(s)\n\nFirstly, you need to add a link on your site to prove ownership.
